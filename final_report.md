The 2024 Paris Olympic Games along with the previous Olympics so far have been one of the most anticipated sporting events worldwide, bringing together athletes from all corners of the globe to compete at the highest level. Predicting outcomes in the Olympics has always been a topic of great interest for sports analysts, coaches, and just fans and viewers like us. Understanding the factors that contribute to an athlete's success can not only enhance the preparation for future games but also provide valuable insights into the dynamics of competitive sports. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of the 2024 Olympic Games by analyzing historical data from past Olympic events. By doing so, we hope to uncover patterns and trends that can help forecast which athletes are most likely to win medals.
