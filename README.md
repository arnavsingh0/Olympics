## Project Summary

Our project aims to predict the outcomes of the 2024 Olympic Games using historical data from previous Olympics. By leveraging various machine learning models we learned from class, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors, we analyzed factors such as age, height, weight, nationality, and event to forecast which athletes are most likely to win medals. The models were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting medalists.
