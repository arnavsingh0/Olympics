\section*{Project Summary}
This project aims to predict the outcomes of the 2024 Olympic Games using historical data from previous Olympics. By leveraging various machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors, we analyzed factors such as age, height, weight, nationality, and event to forecast which athletes are most likely to win medals. The models were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting medalists, providing insights into the factors that influence success in the Olympics.
